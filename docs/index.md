In this lesson, you will allow the player to launch the projectile through the scene. First you will write a new script to send the projectile forwards. Next you will store the projectile along with all of its scripts and properties using an important new concept in Unity called Prefabs. The player will be able to launch the projectile prefab with a tap of the spacebar. Finally, you will add boundaries to the scene, removing any objects that leave the screen.
